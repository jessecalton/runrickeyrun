# Run Rickey Run!

Rickey Henderson, a Hall of Fame outfielder with the Oakland Athletics, was a big personality who was known for talking in the third-person. Such a privilege is earned, not given.

Rickey Henderson played 25 Major League seasons, is a two-time World Series winner, and has the all-time record for stolen bases at 1,406. As it stands, this record is widely regarded as one that will never be broken.
